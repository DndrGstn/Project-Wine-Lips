## Design & Planning:
I chose to create a website for one of my favorite bands, Wine Lips. I really love their energetic, psychedelic aesthetic and wanted to capture and expand on that visual style throughout the site.

My goal was to design an easy-to-navigate website that lets visitors quickly discover who the band is, explore their music, find concert dates, look through merch, and read essential information about the band. The site focuses on a retro, 70s-inspired vibe to match Wine Lips’ look and feel, while still being simple, functional, and enjoyable to use.

### User Stories



### Wireframes
Attach wireframes in this section
### Typography
i use Arial. its very clean and easaly read 
### Colour Scheme
Screenshoot of the colour scheme for your project

## Features:
Explain your features on the website,(navigation, pages, links, forms.....)
### Navigation
The navigation is simple and intuitive. Each section of the site is clearly labeled, and I can move between pages without confusion. All it takes is pressing the button for the page you want, making the site easy to explore even for first-time visitors.
### Footer
### Other features
I implemented a signup form that allows visitors to subscribe for updates from the band. By joining the mailing list, users can receive information about new tours, album releases, and other important announcements. This feature helps keep fans engaged and ensures they never miss out on upcoming events or new music.
